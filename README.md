💻 My [personal website](https://about.ozoniuss.com/) is up again because I found out I can use cloud providers without having to pay them (thank you [Backblaze B2 and Cloudflare](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-and-cloudflare-partner-to-provide-free-data-transfer/)). The source code is also now [publicly available](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/aboutv2).

- Avent of Code was definitely a ride this year, where I was forced to remember how waking up to go to school feels like. Check out my work for this year [here.](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Advent-of-Code/tree/main/advent-of-code-2023) 
- I enjoy implementing packages and small APIs 🔨. For example I wrote [configer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/configer) to manage my configs similarly accross my projects.
- My expense manager 💵 [Casheer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer) is shaping up, now coming with a shitty [UI](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer/tree/main/ui) that is actually functional and I built on my own. I have lost the battle of trying to stay away from frontend.
- Do you like parallel 🤲, concurrent 🤝 and distributed 🙌 programming? Check out some of the things from my [master's]([https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/keyboard-processing](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main)) repository. The short program [context madness](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc/tree/main/context-madness) I wrote is also pretty cool.
- As programmers, we sometimes get to working on pretty random stuff 💣, just for the fun of it. My [Misc](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc) repo contains those moments.
- I'm more of a mathematician 📐, but I do enjoy solving coding problems 💻. Check out [my algorithms repository](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms) to view some of those!
- I love music 💿📻🎼🎧 and play guitar 🎸.

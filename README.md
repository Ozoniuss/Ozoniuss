### Hi there! 🦘

My name is Alex and welcome to my GitHub! (It's a bit of a mess now 😅 but I'm cleaning it up in my free time) I'm currently a Master Student, passionate about programming and this is the place where I keep most of my interesting stuff. Feel free to browse 🖱️

- My short article about microservices is complete now, check it out [here!](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/microservices) Feedback is always welcome 🤭
- I enjoy implementing packages and small APIs. Check out my [configer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/configer) package that I use to configure my projects and my [stdlog](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/stdlog) package that I use for quick logging.
- I'm pretty bad at managing my expenses 💵. For that reason, I decided to built an app for it! [Casheer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer) is my [REST](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) backend and [Clisheer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/clisheer) is a command-line tool I wrote for interacting with it.
- Do you like parallel 🤲, concurrent 🤝 and distributed 🙌 programming? So do I! Check out [this](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/keyboard-processing) and [this](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/theoretical-distributed). The short program [context madness](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc/tree/main/context-madness) I wrote is also pretty cool.
- As programmers, we sometimes get to working on pretty random stuff 💣, just for the fun of it. My [Misc](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc) repo contains those moments.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I'm done solving the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) problems. Check out my contest review and solutions [here!](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/advent-of-code-2022)
- I'm more of a mathematician 📐, but I do enjoy solving coding problems 💻. Check out [my algorithms repository](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms) to view some of those!
- I love music 💿📻🎼🎧 and play guitar 🎸. I did post a couple of solos on my [youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@ozoniuss1463/videos)

💻 Personal [website](https://www.ozoniuss.com/me/) (may be down until I decide to pay cloud providers)

- My short article about microservices is complete now, check it out [here!](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/microservices) Feedback is always welcome 🤭
- I enjoy implementing packages and small APIs 🔨. For example I wrote [configer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/configer) to manage my configs similarly accross my projects.
- I'm pretty bad at managing my expenses 💵 so I decided to built an app for that [Casheer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer) is my [REST](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) backend and [Clisheer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/clisheer) is a command-line tool I wrote for interacting with it. I've put a lot of effort intro structuring and implementing Casheer and I'm quite proud of the result, can't wait for it to be finished.
- Do you like parallel 🤲, concurrent 🤝 and distributed 🙌 programming? Check out some of the things from my [master's]([https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main/keyboard-processing](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Masters-Projects/tree/main)) repository. The short program [context madness](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc/tree/main/context-madness) I wrote is also pretty cool.
- As programmers, we sometimes get to working on pretty random stuff 💣, just for the fun of it. My [Misc](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/misc) repo contains those moments.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I'm done solving the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) problems. Check out my contest review and solutions [here!](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms/tree/master/advent-of-code-2022)
- I'm more of a mathematician 📐, but I do enjoy solving coding problems 💻. Check out [my algorithms repository](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/Algorithms) to view some of those!
- I love music 💿📻🎼🎧 and play guitar 🎸. I did post a couple of solos on my [youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@ozoniuss1463/videos)
